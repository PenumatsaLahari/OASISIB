    <h3 id="headline">Here's a glimpse of Dr.B.R Ambedkar's life:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li> The entire nation knows about the legendary “Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar”. He was one of the greatest leaders of India who was more of a social worker, a writer, and an educationist. He always worked for the Social Justice of untouchables and was the one who drafted Indian Constitution.</li>
     
      <li>
        In 1908, Ambedkar got married at an immature age of 14, to a girl named Ramabai who was nine years old at that time but still, he continued his education and passed the intermediate examination with flying colors. Due to his great interest in studies, Dr. Ambedkar was brilliant from his childhood. His low cast birth made him suffer a lot of discrimination and humiliation in his school. He went to England in 1923 for his higher studies and there, he received the degrees of M.Sc, Ph.D. and DMS law.
      </li>
      <li>
        He was born on 14th April 1891 in a Hindu Mahar low caste family of Harijan which were treated as untouchables. Due to this reason he was never given any attention by the teachers in the school.

Also, he was not allowed to sit in the class but apart from these ample of social and financial problems; Ambedkar completed his matriculation examination in 1907. After that, he took admission in the University of Bombay and he was one of those first untouchable persons to enter a college in India.
      </li>
     
      <li>
        In 1930, Ambedkar represented the untouchable’s community in the roundtable and as a result of his dedication and efforts, the Harijans were granted reservations of seats in the elections and in various other sectors.
      </li>
      <li>
       BR Ambedkar founded the “Independent labor party” in 1936. He was free India’s first law minister who was also the chairman of the drafting committee of Indian Constitution. He became the chairman of the constitution on 29th August 1947.
      </li>
      <li>
        He was successful in introducing reservations for the members of lower classes and tribes in government job civil services education and other factors of the society.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ambedkar believed that it is very important to have Unity in the country among various classes of the society; therefore he focused on the gender, caste and religion equality in the nation. The time he became the chairman of the drafting committee of the Constitution Committee, he studied the constitutions of various countries and gather their good points and assimilated them into Indian Constitution. This is the reason he has called the “Founding Father of Indian Constitution”. People started worshiping him like a God. In his entire life, Ambedkar fought for the upliftment of untouchables and other weaker sections of the society.
      </li>
      <li>
